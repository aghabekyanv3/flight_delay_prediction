# Flight Departure Delay Prediction

## Project Motivation
The motivation behind this project is to create a practical example of applying machine learning techniques, specifically Gaussian Naive Bayes, to predict flight departure delays. This project serves as a demonstration for an article on Naive Bayes and aims to tie machine learning concepts to real-world scenarios, enhancing understanding and applicability.

## Project Description
This project focuses on predicting flight departure delays using a dataset containing various features related to flights, carriers, and airports. The main goal is to build a classification model that can predict whether a flight will experience a departure delay exceeding 15 minutes.
